# Playground

This is my place to test things and share production-ready solutions primary based on Typescript. You can take them and use in your projects as you please.


## What I'm working on at the moment

### React/Relay isomorphic  application with proper server side rendering and hydration. 

You can check it here — `services/relay`

### GraphQL Apollo server.

Here — `services/apollo-server`.

This is a dummy graphql-api for now to check conections from react/relay app. But i'm invested in idea to check how is it suitable for building proper grapqhql service.
